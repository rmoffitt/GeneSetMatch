# GeneSetMatch

## About

## Repository layout

* Data/ holds several bulk and single0-cell RNA-Seq example datasets. These datasets are used for case-study analyses in the associated publication (link and citation forthcoming with publication).
* R/ holds all wrapper functions used in the application
* inst/analysis holds a variety of markdowns and scripts outlining relevant preliminary and in-depth example analytical protocols that GeneSetMatch can be utilized for. Sub-folders include high resolution .pdf files of the corresponding heatmaps generated by respective analyses.
* inst/shiny holds the code for execution of the app (in development)
* man/, as in all R packages, houses .Rd files and will be auto-generated after running devtools::document()

## Installing the package

To install the package, simply run
```
devtools::install_github("rmoffitt/GeneSetMatch")
```
## Workflow

GeneSetMatch offers a variety of analytical pipelines. The individual workflows will differ slightly based on the input data (bulk vs single-cell), desired statistical analyses (DE vs NMF), preparation of data for pathway enrichemnt step (trasformations & filtering) and subsequent visualization (appropriate heatmap selection).
