# GeneSetMatch

## About
GeneSetMatch is a novel methodology and associated software tool which aims to streamline a variety of statistical analyses for large -omic data sets. GeneSetMatch allows the user to access a menu of appropriate differential expression analyses, dimensionality reductions, transformations and a novel informative visualization of the output in a single, user-friendly software tool.

## Repository layout

* Data/ holds several bulk and single0-cell RNA-Seq example datasets. These datasets are used for case-study analyses in the associated publication (link and citation forthcoming with publication).
* R/ holds all wrapper functions used in the application
* inst/analysis holds a variety of markdowns and scripts outlining relevant preliminary and in-depth example analytical protocols that GeneSetMatch can be utilized for. Sub-folders include high resolution .pdf files of the corresponding heatmaps generated by respective analyses.
* inst/shiny holds the code for execution of the app (in development)
* man/, as in all R packages, houses .Rd files and will be auto-generated after running devtools::document()

## Installing the package

To install the package, simply run
```
devtools::install_github("rmoffitt/GeneSetMatch")
```
## Workflow

GeneSetMatch offers a variety of analytical pipelines. The individual workflows will differ slightly based on the input data (bulk vs single-cell), desired statistical analyses (DE vs NMF), preparation of data for pathway enrichemnt step (trasformations & filtering) and subsequent visualization (appropriate heatmap selection).

### Data Structure

To allow smooth implementation, please parse your input data into the following format: a list containing three elements;
* a) a numeric matrix of raw expression data where rows are indexed by gene IDs and columns are indexed by experimental samples
* b) a data frame with information corresponding to all samples, biological replicates, or any other relevant data to the downstream analysis
* c) a data frame ideally containing ENSEMBL, SYMBOL or ENTREZ IDs which correspond to the indexed gene data in the expression matrix. If some gene IDs types are not available, the GeneSetMatch package offers a variety of conversion functions that aid in interspecies gene ID conversions, as well as animal-model-to-human homologues.

### Differential Expression Analysis 

GeneSetMatch offers an extensive menu of DE methods, all of which can be performed without additional manipulation assuming the input data frames is structured appropriately. Available methods exist in the “All_DE_tools_for_concordance_analysis.R” script and will be automatically loaded in with the build of the GeneSetMatch package. Each DE tool expects the same input to perform its analysis; count data (i.e ‘full_data$ex’) and biological condition (i.e ‘full_data$sampInfo$condition’). Each tool returns a data frame with gene IDs as row labels and a variety of statistics as column labels. The user has the option to choose whichever statistic is of most interest, perhaps run several DE analyses in parallel and combine the results into a comprehensive matrix. This step allows for significant flexibility, and as long as the resulting data frame is shaped in a ‘gene vs statistic’ matrix, all of the downstream tools will accept the input.
